# Porridge Revenge
Our game is a modified tower defense game developed on top of the Phaser 3 template. 

## High Concept
After during human abuse for countless centuries, a group of brave porridge ingredients blows up the horn of counter attack. With the escalation of their counter attack, human beings must raise their attention and try to defeat them by making them into porridge.

## Core Gameplay: Mechanics and Dynamics
Control the faucet at the top of the screen to aim at the porridge ingredients and shoot them into the pot below. Chop the larger ingredients into small pieces and then shoot them. Gain coins by shooting enough ingredients into the pot. Upgrade the faucet using the coins collected.
Our game uses the following mechanics: hitting, projecting, damages, destruction/elimination, powerups. From these mechanics, we are allowing for the following dynamics to emerge: collecting, eliminating, predicting, protecting, trading & buying.
The core gameplay loop in our game is hitting and projecting. Our game involves a fair amount of strategy planning with a gradual increase in difficulty level, so it will be a perfect game for players who need a fun and easy game to past time.

## Core Gameplay Aesthetic
Abnegation and problem solving are the two feelings that our game try to provide for our players. First of all, our game has a simple and straightforward UI, so for people who just want to play a game to past time, they do not need to spend a long time figuring out the rules and buttons of the game. Also, the characters in our game are cartoonish and cute, which create a relaxing feeling. Secondly, players can get a sense of accomplishment when they pass each round of the game.

## Look and Feel Aesthetic
The characters are 2D and cartoonish, as the core aesthetic is relaxed, playful, and absurd/humorous given the nature of the game (trying to kill Porridge ingredients). The figure above is our hand-drawn concept art of the game. Colors will be bright, and lighting constant. There is no emphasis on exact realism on any of the art assets, just a cartoonish kind of realism.
